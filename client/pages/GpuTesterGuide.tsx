            </p>
          </div>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Understanding Modern GPU Architecture</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            Today's graphics cards are marvels of engineering, containing thousands of processing cores working in parallel to render complex 3D scenes. Understanding the basics of GPU architecture helps you interpret test results and identify potential issues more effectively.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Modern GPUs consist of several key components: shader cores (the primary processing units), memory controllers, render output units, and specialized hardware for ray tracing and AI acceleration. Each component has specific performance characteristics, and testing helps identify which areas might be limiting your overall performance.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">NVIDIA vs AMD Architecture</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            NVIDIA's recent RTX series emphasizes ray tracing and DLSS technology, while AMD's RDNA architecture focuses on traditional rasterization performance and memory efficiency. These architectural differences mean that testing approaches may vary depending on your specific hardware and intended use cases.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Understanding your GPU's architecture helps you interpret benchmark results more accurately. For example, NVIDIA cards might show higher scores in ray tracing tests, while AMD cards often excel in traditional rendering benchmarks. Neither result is inherently better—it depends on the games you play and features you prioritize.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">WebGL Testing: The Browser-Based Advantage</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            While dedicated benchmarking software has its place, WebGL testing offers unique advantages for everyday users. Browser-based tests like <Link to="/gpu-tester" className="text-primary hover:underline font-medium">GamepadTest's GPU Tester</Link> provide instant results without downloads, installations, or compatibility concerns. This accessibility makes regular testing much more practical for most users.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            WebGL tests are particularly valuable because they reflect real-world browser performance—increasingly important as web-based gaming and applications become more sophisticated. Many modern games use similar rendering techniques to WebGL, making these tests surprisingly relevant for gaming performance assessment.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Interpreting WebGL Results</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            WebGL benchmarks typically measure several key metrics: triangle throughput (how many triangles your GPU can render per second), fill rate (how quickly it can draw pixels), and shader performance (how efficiently it processes complex visual effects). Understanding these metrics helps you identify specific performance bottlenecks.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Triangle throughput indicates your GPU's ability to handle complex 3D models—crucial for modern games with detailed environments and characters. Fill rate affects performance at higher resolutions, while shader performance impacts visual quality settings like lighting, shadows, and post-processing effects.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Step-by-Step GPU Testing Process</h2>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">1. Baseline System Preparation</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Before testing, ensure your system is in optimal condition. Close unnecessary applications, update graphics drivers, and allow your system to reach normal operating temperatures. Background processes can significantly skew test results, so a clean testing environment is essential for accurate measurements.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Monitor your GPU temperature using built-in tools or third-party software. Most modern GPUs begin thermal throttling around 83-87°C, which can dramatically impact performance. If your card runs hot, consider improving case ventilation or cleaning dust from cooling components before testing.

            Run comprehensive performance tests covering different aspects of GPU functionality. Start with basic rendering tests to establish baseline performance, then progress to more demanding scenarios that stress different hardware components. Pay attention to both average performance and performance consistency—frame time variance can be more important than peak framerates for gaming experience.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Modern GPU testing should include various rendering scenarios: simple geometry with basic textures, complex scenes with advanced lighting, and stress tests that push memory bandwidth and processing power to their limits. Each test reveals different aspects of your hardware's capabilities and potential limitations.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">4. Stress Testing and Stability</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Extended stress testing reveals issues that might not appear during brief benchmarks. Run longer tests to identify thermal throttling, driver stability issues, or memory problems that could affect gaming performance. Professional overclockers often run stress tests for hours to verify system stability under extreme conditions.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Analyzing and Interpreting Results</h2>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Understanding Performance Metrics</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            GPU test results typically include several key metrics. Frame rate measures how smoothly your GPU can render animations and is crucial for gaming responsiveness. Triangle throughput indicates how well your card handles complex 3D models, while memory bandwidth affects performance with high-resolution textures and multiple displays.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Don't focus solely on peak performance numbers. Consistency metrics like frame time variance and 1% low framerates often matter more for actual gaming experience. A GPU that maintains steady 60fps performs better than one that fluctuates between 40-80fps, even if the latter has higher average framerates.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Identifying Performance Bottlenecks</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Poor performance can stem from various sources: insufficient GPU power, memory bandwidth limitations, CPU bottlenecks, or thermal throttling. Testing helps isolate these issues by stressing different hardware components individually. Understanding bottlenecks guides optimization efforts and upgrade decisions.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Memory-related bottlenecks often appear as reduced performance at higher resolutions or with complex textures. Processing bottlenecks typically affect all rendering scenarios equally. Thermal issues usually manifest as performance degradation over time rather than immediate poor performance.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Optimizing GPU Performance</h2>
